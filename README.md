# CLI Games

A collection of command-line games written without any dependencies. The purpose of this project was to practice object-oriented programming and implement more advanced console input/output.

## Details

The project features several dynamic views, including 3 different games (Tictactoe, Hangman, and Word Guess). Each game is complete with several end-game conditions. As well as that, the program also displays dynamic warnings if it receives any invalid user input.
